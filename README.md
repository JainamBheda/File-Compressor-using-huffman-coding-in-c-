# File Compressor and Decompressor in C++

A simple command-line file compressor and decompressor implemented in C++ using the Huffman coding algorithm. This project demonstrates techniques in data compression, file I/O, and modern C++ practices (C++17). The primary goal is to efficiently compress and decompress text files using Huffman encoding, which is widely used for lossless data compression.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To build this project, you need:

- A C++17-compatible compiler:
  - **g++** (Linux/macOS)
  - **clang++** (macOS)
  - **MSVC** (Windows)
- **CMake** (optional, but recommended for managing the build)
- **Git** for cloning the repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building

### 1. Using g++ directly

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JainamBheda/file_compressor_decompressor_in_c++.git
cd file_compressor_decompressor_in_c++

# Compile all source files
# On Linux/macOS:
g++ -std=c++17 \
  FrequencyCounter.cpp \
  Huffman.cpp \
  HuffmanUtility.cpp \
  Node.cpp \
  main.cpp \
  -o huffman

# On Windows (PowerShell or CMD):
g++ -std=c++17 FrequencyCounter.cpp Huffman.cpp HuffmanUtility.cpp Node.cpp main.cpp -o huffman.exe
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

- FrequencyCounter.cpp: Contains the logic for counting the frequency of characters in the input text.

- Huffman.cpp: Implements the Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms.

- HuffmanUtility.cpp: Utility functions for file I/O and other helper operations.

- Node.cpp: Defines the node structure used in the Huffman tree.

- main.cpp: The entry point for the program, responsible for handling the command-line interface.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Multithreading Support: Implement parallel processing to speed up compression and decompression for larger files.

- Error Handling: Add better error handling for edge cases like corrupted files or unsupported formats.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Provide a GUI for users who prefer not to use the command line.

- Support for Other Compression Algorithms: Integrate other popular compression algorithms like LZ77 or Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

## üéØ Conclusion
This file compressor and decompressor project is an effective demonstration of how Huffman coding can be applied to text file compression. It highlights the power of lossless data compression, helping reduce file sizes for easier storage and transmission. With a modular design and simple command-line interface, this project serves as a solid foundation for learning and implementing compression algorithms in C++. Future improvements can expand its functionality, making it a more versatile tool for various use cases.
